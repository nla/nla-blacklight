# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). 

## [1.0.8] - 2019-08-12
### Fixed
- Throws error when query fails with a 200 status code and html error message (query = `the meaning of life or 4=2`), see #90.
- Raises a specific "record not found" error instead of a generic "bad request" error when a record cannot be retrieved, see #88.

## [1.0.7] - 2018-12-05
### Changed
- logger dependency removed since it's been part of the standard library.

## [1.0.6] - 2018-11-14
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the cached auth key isn't deleted if it expires before its cache expiration. This should only occur in rare cases where the auth token cache expiration exceeds 30 minutes.
### Added
- Cache expiration is configurable for individual EDS API calls (time unit = seconds).
### Changed
- Default cache expiration for auth keys is now 25 minutes instead of 30 to make sure they are always refreshed before their 30 minute expiration. If an expiration is configured longer than 25 minutes, it is reset to 25 minutes automatically.

## [1.0.5] - 2018-11-02
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where fulltext html becomes nil after sanitizing. [#85](https://github.com/ebsco/edsapi-ruby/issues/85) 
- Fixed a bug where the url protocol is missing from fulltext custom links. [#86](https://github.com/ebsco/edsapi-ruby/issues/86)

## [1.0.4] - 2018-10-29
### Fixed
- List retrieval returns a repeating list of just the first record. 
- List retrieval fails to increment the EDS result id.

## [1.0.3] - 2018-10-18
### Changed
- Citation style and export links can now be removed entirely or replaced by specifying regular expressions in several configuration options that can include ruby erb variable expressions for an item's `dbid` and `an`. This was added to address situations where customer proxy urls are returned. See: [Citation link replacement](https://github.com/ebsco/edsapi-ruby/wiki/Citation-link-replacement)

# nla-blacklight

Custom implementation of [Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org/) for The National Library of Australia.

ðŸš¨ The versions below should match the versions available in the UBI Ruby base container image.

* Base container image: ubi8/ruby-30
* Ruby: 3.0.2
* Bundler: 2.2.22


* System dependencies
    - Solr: 8
    - MySQL: 8

## Configuration

All configurable values should be defined via environment variables and `dotenv` is used to load these values
into the application.

Non-sensitive values for development/test environments should be defined in the `.env.development`/`.env.test` files.

Sensitive values should be defined in `.env.development.local`/`.env.test.local` files and not committed to source
control.

### Environment Variables

#### Blacklight database
    DATABASE_URL

#### Solr
    SOLR_URL

#### Temp and caching directories
    BLACKLIGHT_TMP_PATH
    BLACKLIGHT_STORAGE_PATH

## Setup

1. Pull down the app from version control.
2. Make sure you have MySQL running.
3. `bin/setup` installs gems, npm packages, and database migrations for development/test environments.

## Running the app

1. `bin/run` runs the Rails server at 0.0.0.0:3000.
2. `bin/dev` runs the SASS compiler in "watch" mode, in parallel with the Rails server.

## Tests and CI

1. `bin/ci` contains all the tests and security vulnerability checks for the app.
2. `tmp/test.log` will use the production logging format *NOT* the development one.

## Production

* All runtime configuration should be supplied in the UNIX environment as environment variables.
* Rails logging uses [lograge](https://github.com/roidrage/lograge). `bin/setup help` can tell you how to see this locally.

## Security / Vulnerability Checking

* [brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman) is a static analysis vulnerability checker.
    * Reports are written to `tmp/brakeman.html`
* [bundler-audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit) checks for vulnerabilities in application dependencies.

## Containers

There is a `Dockerfile` in the `./solr` directory that can be used to spin up a local Solr instance. This instance
is configured to pre-create a core named `blacklight-core`.

First, build the container, then run the new image:

```bash
docker build -t blacklight-solr ./solr
docker run -p 8983:8983 blacklight-solr
```

You should now be able to load the Solr Dashboard at: http://localhost:8983/solr/#/

## .dockerdev

This directory contains a `Dockerfile` that generates an application image based on RedHat's UBI Ruby image
(see version above).
It also includes a `compose.yml` file that defines supporting services (MySQL, Solr).

Together, [Dip](https://github.com/bibendi/dip) and the `dip.yml` configuration file provide a convenient way to
interact with a containerised local development environment. This local development image and the production
container image are the same version.

It is recommended to maintain as much parity with production as possible by upgrading the versions of these
supporting services at the same time they are upgraded by Tech Ops.

### Install Dip

```bash
gem install dip
```

#### Common Commands

- `dip provision` pulls down container images and create containers, volumes and networks.
- `dip down --volumes` removes all containers, volumes and networks.
- `dip up` is the same as `docker-compose up`.
- `dip stop` is the same as `docker-compose stop`.
- `dip rails s` runs the Rails server at http://localhost:3000.
- `dip runner` opens a terminal in the Rails container with all supporting services.
- `dip bash` opens a terminal in the Rails container without supporting services.

### Development Workflow

```bash
dip provision # pull container images and build application image (if needed)
dip up # start all the containers
dip stop # stop all the containers

# if you need to run commands in a terminal
dip runner
```

### Populating Solr Index

There is a sample of Voyager MARC records in `./solr/voy-sample`.

Load a terminal in a container with all the system dependencies available, then index the sample MARC records:

```bash
dip runner
bin/rails solr:marc:index MARC_FILE=./solr/voy-sample
```

## Contributing

The [GoRails guide](https://gorails.com/setup) has great instructions for setting up Ruby, Rails and MySQL for your operating system.

‚úèÔ∏è This repository uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
and commit messages are used to generate `CHANGELOG.md` and release body entries.

The most important prefixes you should have in mind are:

* `fix:` which represents bug fixes, and correlates to a SemVer patch.
* `feat:` which represents a new feature, and correlates to a SemVer minor.
* `feat!:`, or `fix!:`, `refactor!:`, etc., which represent a breaking change (indicated by the !) and will result in a SemVer major.

Releases are automated via GitHub workflows. See more in the ["Releases"](#releases) section.

## Configuration

All configurable values should be defined via environment variables. `dotenv` will automatically load values
from the `.env*` config in development and test environments.

Non-sensitive values for development and test environments should be defined in the `.env.development`/`.env.test` files.

Sensitive values can be defined in `.env.development.local` or `.env.test.local` files for local development
and *SHOULD NOT* be committed to source control. Git is configured to ignore these files.

‚ö†Ô∏è If `dotenv` fails to load the configuration values into the environment, you can manually export these
values in your terminal before running the application.

</details>

## Setup

1. Clone the app from GitHub.
2. Make sure you have MySQL running locally and configured in the `.env.development.local` config file.
3. Make sure you have Redis running locally and configured in the `.env.development.local` config file.
4. Make sure you have Solr running locally and configured in the `.env.development.local` config file.<br />üí°Ô∏è  If you are not planning on modifying the Solr index, you can point this at the  devel or test environment Solr cluster.
5. `bin/setup` installs gems and performs database migrations for the `development` environment.<br /> üí°Ô∏è Gems are installed in `vendor/bundle`.

## Running the app

* `bin/dev` runs the Rails server at http://localhost:3000.
    * This will compile the SASS stylesheets and package up the JavaScript files for the asset pipeline. 
    * By default Rails will load the `development` environment.
    * The runtime environment can be changed by defining `RAILS_ENV` before executing a command/script. e.g.

```bash
RAILS_ENV=test bin/dev
```

## Tests

* `bin/ci` contains all the tests and security vulnerability checks for the app.
* `tmp/test.log` will use the production logging format *NOT* the development one.
* The following test frameworks are used:
    * [RSpec](https://rspec.info/)
    * [Capybara](http://teamcapybara.github.io/capybara/) - simulates web application interaction
    * [Webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) - HTTP request mocking and stubbing

## Continuous Integration

* CI is performed by [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
* Workflows are defined in `.github/workflows`.

### Releases

Releases are automated via the `release.yml` GitHub workflow. This uses Google's
[release-please action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action) to create a 
release pull request when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. 

üö® This release pull request will be updated with every merge to the `main` branch. 

üö® It will bump the version automatically and create a release when it is merged.

üö® `CHANGELOG.md` is automatically created/updated for each release based on the commit messages.

Read more about how
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) works.

## Deployment

* All runtime configuration should be supplied as environment variables.
* Rails logging uses [lograge](https://github.com/roidrage/lograge). `bin/setup help` can tell you how to see this locally.
* The temporary file directory configured by the `BLACKLIGHT_TMP_PATH` must be writable by the user that runs the application.
* Gems declared in the Gemfile are installed in the `vendor/bundle` directory.
* Rails assets must be precompiled before deployment and `RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES` set to `true` in order for files in the `public` directory to be accessible.
* `RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT` must be set to `true` for logs to be sent to the console.

## Linting, Static Analysis & Supply Chain Vulnerability Checking

The following tools provide linting, security and vulnerability checking of the code.

* [rubocop](https://rubocop.org/) and [standardrb](https://github.com/testdouble/standard) ensure standardised code formatting and best practices.
* [brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman) provides static analysis checking.
    * Reports are written to `tmp/brakeman.html`
* [bundler-audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit) checks application dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
* [strong-migrations](https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations) catches unsafe migrations in development.
